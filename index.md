{% include JB/setup %}

Came across [Dave Rupert's blog](http://daverupert.com) recently, and the blog looked so simple and amazingly fast that made me try the jekyll framework.

I referred the following two links for the whole blog setup:
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)

The setup was pretty simple and didn't take much time.

Basic files you will have to edit after the whole setup is done are going to be is 'index.md' which reflects what appears on your blog's homepage.
All your posts gets stored in the directory - '_posts'
All the pages gets stored in the home directory itself but you can have nested pages by using a syntax like this:

$ rake page name="pages/about.md"

The above details would help you setup your simple blog, if you need any other help just leave a comment or tweet and I would love to help you out with your blog setup.

Enjoy using Jekyll!
